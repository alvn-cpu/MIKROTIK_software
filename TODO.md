# WiFi Billing System Deployment Fix

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Fix Dockerfile to properly copy package.json files before npm install for workspaces
- [x] Build React frontend locally
- [x] Update Dockerfile to build frontend during Docker build and include in backend image
- [x] Fix multi-stage build to have backend inherit from frontend-build stage
- [x] Ensure frontend dependencies are properly installed in frontend-build stage
- [x] Backend server.js already configured to serve React frontend for routes like /admin
- [x] Update backend .env file with new PostgreSQL and Redis URLs
- [x] Push changes to repository and redeploy on Railway

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Redeploy on Railway to apply the Docker build fixes
- [ ] Verify /admin route serves the React AdminDashboard page
- [ ] Test other frontend routes (/, /login, /dashboard, etc.)
- [ ] Confirm API endpoints under /api/* still work

## Notes
- Dockerfile updated to copy package.json files from backend and frontend before running npm ci
- This should resolve the ENOENT error during Docker build
- Backend stage now runs `node server.js` which is the full server
- Dockerfile now builds the React frontend and copies it to the backend image
- Backend serves the React app for non-API routes, allowing /admin to load the AdminDashboard component
- If frontend build fails during deployment, backend will serve API-only mode with helpful messages
